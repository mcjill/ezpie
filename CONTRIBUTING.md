# How to Contribute to Ezpie

Ezpie is not just another free and open-source site for average developers. It's for learning by teaching, it's not easy to code by just learning how to, but when you share your experience with others, you learn more then just how to! 😃

**WARNING:** Before you proceed, please take a minute to read ezpie's [Code of Conduct](https://github.com/EzpieCo/ezpie/blob/master/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md). We enforce it across our repo so that contributing to ezpie is a fun experience for everyone.

## Dependencies and Requirement

Most of Ezpie is written with [astro](https://astro.build). Like this there are not limits for anyone, if you are a react developer you can add react components, vue, svelte etc all are always together!

If you want to help, but don't know react, now you can use vue components instead! So spacial thanks to astro!
