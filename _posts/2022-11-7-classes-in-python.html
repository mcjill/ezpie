        <p class="text">
            The Fetch API is the modern way of making <b>HTTP</b> requests to servers from a web browsers.
            The Fetch API is quite simpler and understandable, plus you may have used the <b>XMLHttpRequest</b>,
            which is al lot longer and less understandable than the fetch API. More on, the fetch API can do things
            the same way the XMLHttpRequest does.

            The code used in this article is available in <a href="https://github.com/ishaan010/understanding-fetch-api"
                class="link">GitHub</a>
        </p>
        <p class="text">
            The <b>fetch()</b> requires only one parameter which is just the URL of the api/resource that you
            want to fetch. The fetch() method returns a promise so that we can use the <b>then()</b> and
            <b>catch()</b> methods to handle the system:

        <h2 class="head">How to read the responce?</h2>
        <p class="text">
            If the data is in text form you can use the <b>text()</b> method. This method returns the data in a
            simple text format.
        </p>
        <script src="https://gist.github.com/ishaan010/056c444d2fb13c8c207cb780ba8fba8e.js"></script>
        <p class="text">
            But the best practice is to use the <b>async</b> and <b>await</b>, we use this becuase this provides us
            an alternative syntax for handling the responce of the Fetch request and other methods.
        </p>
        <script src="https://gist.github.com/ishaan010/d7447c188d1e9edbaed5e28dc7dc3f4e.js"></script>
        <p class="text">
            For this time we are using the <b>text()</b> method, but this is not possible for <b>json</b>,
            <b>form data</b>, etc. For them the fetch() method have <b>json()</b>,
            <b>formData()</b>,<b>arrayBuffer()</b> and more.

        <h2 class="head">Handling status code</h2>
        <p class="text">
            This is one of the most known responce you may have seen on typing a wrong url on a site: <br>
            <strong>404</strong>
        </p>
        <p class="text">
            But have you ever though what this is? Well if no then here's your answer
        </p>
        <p class="text">
            This is called a status code, what this means is that, while you send a request to the server of a site
            there was some error on your side, but there was no error on the server side, so basically this means
            that you typed the url wrong.
        </p>
        <p class="text">
            In requesting APIs from the server you should always tell the status code, because it helps us to do
            actions as per the situation.
        </p>
        <p class="text">
            Say, you got a status code of <i>200/OK</i>, that would mean that you should display a message telling
            the client that their action was successful and if it gives a status code of <i>404/page not found</i>
            then the other way round.
        </p>
        <p class="text">
            Here's how you can handle status code using the <b>status</b> and <b>statusText</b> methods of the
            Responce object.
        </p>
        <script src="https://gist.github.com/ishaan010/84d8dd3237060a8e47a139e6e951fd56.js"></script>
        <p class="text">
            As you can see here, we are fetching some text and then we check the status code to see if it's
            successful or not if yes then send a text to the user telling them their action was a success.
        </p>
        <p class="text">
            <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_HTTP_status_codes" class="link">Here</a> you can get to
            know more about status code.

        <h2 class="head">Example of using it in a website</h2>
        <p class="text">
            Now lets try to make a site that renders three people with their Name, age and net worth.
        </p>
        <p class="text">
            First lets make a simple html skeleton, if you don't know about html don't worry you won't need to
            memorize anything
        </p>
        <script src="https://gist.github.com/ishaan010/a0d419c94ace19f3af3830f68838555a.js"></script>
        <p>
            As you can see here in the index.html we are just getting the main.js file and using it. Now lets add
            some javascript to it.
        </p>
        <p class="text">
            Before that we will be needing some json to play with.
        </p>
        <script src="https://gist.github.com/ishaan010/31684d1d74fb0f93b181686c34c54fc2.js"></script>
        <p class="text">
            As you can see from this, we have data about three people- their name, age and net worth.
            Now lets add some json and see this in action.
        </p>
        <script src="https://gist.github.com/ishaan010/9dca25b9e38d35c0debb61c8760283bd.js"></script>
        <p class="text">
            If you like you can also add some css to it. Here's how it will look like:
        </p>
        <video
            src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/104765117/196686974-c9961666-4a41-4e85-a623-96c8bfddfa87.mp4"
            width="100%" autoplay loop></video>
        <p class="text">
            As you can see using just few lines of javascript code helped us in such a big way. It reduced the use
            of html code by just writting 4-5 line of html code. By the way this is how I keep all the tag pages up
            and running &#128521
