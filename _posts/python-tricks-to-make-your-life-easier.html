            <h1 class="head">Python tricks to make your life easier</h1>
            <p class="text">
                Everyone knows about Python, especially those who have just written their own first code. But no doubt
                that, python is the most popular and very simple to understand. But like any other language, python also
                have many tricks which I guess non of us knew(till now!).
            </p>
            <p class="text">
                So here are the top 6 tricks that will help you code better rather than code more!

            <h2 class="head">Trick 1: more like golang</h2>
            <p class="text">
                If you have ever used <a href="https://go.dev" class="link">golang</a> then you may know about the
                smallest way of defining a variable in it, using the <b>:=</b> operator.
            </p>
            <p class="text">
                This operator is known as the walrus The latest version of python now have this operator used for
                defining a variable in a conditions
                statement, loop etc. Just like other normal languages we know about.
            </p>

            <p class="text">
                <b>NOTE:</b> your python version must be above 3.8 for this trick

            <h2 class="head">Trick 2: zip the code</h2>
            <p class="text">
                Imagin if you want to generate a dictionary using two list, how will you do that? By using the zip()
                function!
            </p>
            <p class="text">
                This function allows us to merge two list into one, cool way to combine things together.
            </p>
            <script src="https://gist.github.com/ishaan010/884623ba744feade6b046357141eab66.js"></script>
            Output:
            <div class="code">
                Bill Gates <br>
                Larry page <br>
                Elon mask
            </div>
            <p class="text">
                How about merging these two list into one dictionary?
            </p>

            <p class="text">
                Output:
            </p>
            <div class="code">
                {"Bill":"Gates", "Larry":"page", "Elon":"mask"}

        <section class="trick-three">
            <h2 class="head">Trick 3: Remove the replica</h2>
            <p class="text">
                One list can have more than one replica of an item in it, therefore there are chances that you may not
                get the results you what sometimes(Basically always) so to prevent this what you can do is store that
                data using the <b>set()</b> function(set data type)
            </p>

            <p class="text">
                Output:
            </p>
            <div class="code">
                {64, 67, 36, 70, 40, 60}

            <h2 class="head">Trick 4: safety first</h2>
            <p class="text">
                Passwords can be hacked, so to prevent that you can use the <b>getpass()</b> function from the
                <b>getpass</b> library.

            <p class="text">
                Output:
            </p>
            <div class="code">
                password: <br>
                You login was successful
            </div>
            <p class="text">
                The fanny part is that, when you will type you wont get to know the password, as it does not shows!

            <h2 class="head">Trick 5: From the lest to the highest</h2>
            <p class="text">
                Try this, you have given a list of numbers like this <font class="code">[25,62,6,2,53,63,56]</font>. Now
                try to return a list that contains these numbers in ascending order.
            </p>
            <p class="text">
                To do this the easy way just use the <b>sorted()</b> function. This is a list method used to return a
                list in a ascending order.

                [2,6,25,53,56,62,63]

            <h2 class="head">Trick 6: Slice it into a list</h2>
            <p class="text">
                Take a string and slice it into a list means that, each word is to be an item of the list. And I know
                You will do it like this:
            </p>
            <script src="https://gist.github.com/ishaan010/71ae7c85114e54c05d9206f110f0765b.js"></script>
            <p class="text">
                Well here's what I think of this,'This is the most dumbest way of slicing a string!!' But here's how you
                should really do it:
            </p>
            <script src="https://gist.github.com/ishaan010/be9f9185fe5531f2295e889c5b65c96c.js"></script>
            <p class="text">
                Output:
            </p>
            <div class="code">
                ['This', 'is','sliced','into','a','list']
            </div>
            <p class="text">
                Even they are both right, but when it comes to writing code you must go for the shortest path.
            </p>

                post. So surely why not share this right?
